This directory contains all the ROS files for obtaining the temperature sensor data (MLX90620) from the microcontroller (Arduino MEGA) and for displaying the data in a graphic user interface.

Dependencies
-------
- rospy
- cpp (This dependency is not really needed for this package)

Function
------
 - GUIMLX90620.py: once there is a publisher node running with the data being generated by the sensor in an int16 array format, this code creates a listener node for obtaining the data from the publisher and at the same time it is displayed on a GUI.
